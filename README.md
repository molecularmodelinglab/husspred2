# HuSSPred WebPlatform

This GitHub repository contains the code for the **HuSSPred WebPlatform**, a machine learning-based tool designed for predicting the human skin sensitization potential of chemical agents. The platform provides an accessible and reliable method for regulatory toxicology and risk assessment.

## ðŸ“‚ Batch Predictions

The **Batch Predictions** folder contains workflows that allow users to perform batch predictions using a Jupyter notebook. Users can download the Jupyter Notebook file and replace the first line with the path to their actual Excel file. 

### **Excel File Requirements**
- The Excel file must contain a column named: **"QSAR_READY_SMILES"**, which includes SMILES representations of the chemical structures.
